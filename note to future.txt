i'm officially giving up on 2d-hdr, it's way too buggy and has far too many colorspacing issues

the main problem is that, when drawing something over top of something else using a shader, the lower layer bleeds through into the default mix() function and breaks the whole thing.

i also tried manually performing mixing, whereby making a=1.0 frags completely replace the screen color, and a=0.0 frags just display the screen color, but then in the a=0.0 sections, the color would be ever so slightly lighter by some random margin. it is really just too much to mess with

i'll probably end up making my own bloom shader and maybe come back to hdr once the game is more finished idk
