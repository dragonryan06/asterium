# Asterium alpha v0.0.0

A deep spacefaring-simulator that will absolutely take long enough to develop for me to lose interest.

There will be a real readme here at some point, for now please consult the [wiki](https://github.com/dragonryan06/asterium/wiki) where I will be documenting player-facing and under-the-hood elements alike.

Also if you want to help with the project, let me know! I don't really have any systems set up in this repo because right now its just me but I would be happy to have some help!
