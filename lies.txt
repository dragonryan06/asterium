technically, sulfur dioxide so2 reacts with water h2o to form *sulfurous* acid, not sulfuric acid,
this distinction is not important in the context of the game, however, and so i will consider them to be the same thing
sulfuric acid is also colorless, but, so that sulfur still colors atmospheres, i am making it yellow
