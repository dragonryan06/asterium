a world can be a planet or a moon

worlds can be divided into two types:

Terrestrial
	- generated space sprite
	- "orbital" layer (representing low orbit)
	- "aerial" layer (regardless of if air is present)
	- "ground" layer
Gaseous
	- generated space sprite
	- "orbital" layer (representing low orbit)
	- "aerial" layer (could even just be a solid, foggy color or have pretty clouds; bespin)


Terrestrial worlds can be classified as:
	- Barren world (the moon), little to no atmosphere, almost uniform composition, no tectonic activity
	- Smothered world (venus), extremely high atmosphere, any composition, probably tectonic activity
	- Ocean world (kamino), standardish atmosphere, >95% surface area covered by liquid
	- 

	(other ideas)
	- Tomb world (jakku), planet defined by wreckage and ruins, most always uninhabitable or dangerous
	- Gem world, planet defined by frequent occurance of metamorphic rock and gemstones, beautiful from space
